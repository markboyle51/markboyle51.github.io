    <h3>Mark Boyle</h3>
    <p>Mark was a very loving family man. Nothing meant more to him than his children and grandchildren. He was a hardworking man who knew how to have fun. A good time was always to be had with Mark. He was the kind of guy who could light up a room.</p>

          <h4>Father</h4>
          <h5>(Greatest Dad Ever)</h5>

          <h4>Grandpa</h4>
          <h5>(Papa Mark)</h5>
          <p>Mark spent all of his free time with his grandkids. He would show up in the middle of the day just to watch cartoons with them. Even though Mark had bad knees and a hard time walking he would never say no when his grandkids wanted to go for a bike ride or play in the backyard. Marks favorite past time was just being with his grandkids, no matter what they had planned whether it was a nice lunch and some shopping or just hanging out at home.</p>

          <h4>Business Man</h4>
          <h5>(Cement Contractor)</h5>
          <p>Mark was a hardworking Concrete contractor. He was the first local contractor to have a curb and gutter machine in the valley and did all the curb and gutter west of the 99. One of his first big projects was constructing the Ashlan overpass, which still stands today. While he was never formally educated as an engineer he, all by himself, engineered some of the most complicated cement projects on the west coast, including a cantilever deck over the San Francisco Bay meant to hold some of the biggest cranes in the United States. </p>

          <h4>Best Friend</h4>
          <h5>(Ex Son-in-Law)</h5>
          <p>Mark had a very special relationship with a very unexpected person. His best friend was his ex father-in-law Frank Caglia. On the weekends, the two were inseparable. Mark, along with his kids, and Frank were always fixing one of Frank's many ragtag projects. One day they might be fixing frozen water pipes at the Warnors Theater and the next maybe saving some old Fresno landmark from destruction. Mark, with his kids, spent every Tuesday night Barbecuing steaks for his ex-in-laws and every sunday morning making them breakfast.</p>

          <h4>Dog Owner</h4>
          <h5>(Animal Lover)</h5>
          <p>Mark had two beautiful dogs named Lucy and Barbie. These two special ladies went everywhere Mark did. That included all of his errands, like the store and even the Doctors office. If it was too hot or cold outside Mark would leave his car running just to make sure his girls stayed comfortable. He would hand make all of their meals and take them for daily rides to his daughter's house to play with his grandkids and maybe go for a swim.</p>
